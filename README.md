# Skill-Rary

The Skill Rary is an online learning platform. It is aimed at professional adults .Unlike academic massive open online course (MOOC) programs which are driven by traditional collegiate coursework, Demy uses content from online content creators to sell for profit. Skill Rary provides tools which enable users to create a course, promote it and earn money from student tuition charges. No Skill Rary courses are currently credentialed for college credit; students take courses largely as a means of improving job-related skills. Courses generate credit toward technical certification. Skill Rary has made a special effort to attract corporate trainers seeking to create coursework for employees of their company.
